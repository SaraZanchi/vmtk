## News

### Mar 3, 2012: Announcement: vmtk at the CFD in Medicine and Biology Conference, Dead Sea. 

For anyone attending the Computational Fluid Dynamics in Medicine and Biology Conference (in conjunction with the 7th International Biofluid Mechanics Symposium), March 25 - 30, 2012, Crowne Plaza Dead Sea, Ein Bokek, Dead Sea, Israel. I (Luca) will be giving a talk on Monday and I'll be available at the [Orobix](http://www.orobix.com) desk (we are among the [conference sponsors](http://www.engconfintl.org/12adsponsors.html)).

Please come up and bring your own data. I'll be giving a couple of free mini-tutorials during the social hours on Monday and Thursday evening. 

If you're interested in making arrangements upfront, email me at *luca dot antiga at orobix dot com*.

### Mar 3, 2012: Website transition complete

Thanks to the work of Sara Zanchi and Valentina Rossi, who just joined us at Orobix for their internship and helped us porting the tutorials, the transition to the Github-hosted website has been completed. Take a look at the [website repository](https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk.github.com) to see how it's done. Thanks to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), we could reproduce the same urls.

By the way, last night I also switched off the Sourceforge svn and git repositories. From now on, [https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk](https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk) takes over.

### Feb 29, 2012: Website migrated to Github

The vmtk website is being migrated to [Github](https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk.github.com) and released under a Creative Commons license. It is a git repostory itself, so feel free to fork it, add a tutorial or two and send us a pull request.

Should you have issues with the new site, the old one will still available at [http://oldsite.vmtk.org](http://oldsite.vmtk.org).

### Feb 29, 2012: Official repository moved to Github, vmtk organization

After several years with Sourceforge, the official git repository for vmtk has been moved to Github. To this end we created a [vmtk organization](https://github.com/vmtk) which hosts the git repository for vmtk, for the website and for related software.

### Sep 29, 2011: Compilation instructions updated

The instructions for compiling from source have been updated. Thanks to recent developments in CMake, the compilation phase for vmtk will also download and compile VTK and ITK for you, all with the right CMake options. To get this feature, make sure you download the development version from the git repository.
